# Style Guide

This style guide outlines the coding conventions and standards we use in our project. By following these guidelines, we can ensure that our code is consistent, readable, and maintainable.

## Code Formatting

- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- Use Unix-style line endings (\n).
- Use double quotes for strings, and single quotes for characters.

## Naming Conventions

- Use `lowercase_with_underscores` for variable and function names.
- Use `UpperCaseCamelCase` for class names.

## Comments

- Use comments to explain the "why" behind your code, not the "what".
- Write comments in complete sentences with proper grammar and punctuation.
- Use inline comments sparingly, and only when necessary to clarify the code.

## Documentation

- Include a README file in the root directory of your project that provides an overview of the project and instructions for how to use it.
- Use docstrings to document functions and classes.

## Miscellaneous

- Keep your code simple and easy to understand.
- Write code that is modular and reusable.
- Avoid using global variables whenever possible.

By following these guidelines, we can ensure that our code is consistent, easy to read, and maintainable. If you have any questions or comments about these guidelines, please feel free to reach out to the project maintainers.
